# Why Consider Relocating to Minnesota?

Transplanting for your own or your family’s safety is one of the hardest decisions you’ll make in your life. So many of us find ourselves bogged down in “can’ts” - I can’t leave my friends, I can’t leave my family, I can’t adjust to life in a new city. It’s a terrifying situation to be in. 

But you *can*. You *can* get out. You *can* find new community. You *can* be happy.

Minnesota has a reputation for being progressive, inclusive, and supportive of LGBT rights. The north star state might be an ideal place for you and your family.

## Tim Walz

> "Minnesota always has and always will be there to provide shelter from the storm...I still believe with all my heart, America can be a place where no child is left hungry, no community is left behind and no one gets told they don’t belong. And the reason I believe it so strongly is I've seen it with my own eyes, because it's happened right here in Minnesota. And because of our example, millions of Americans believe in it too."
