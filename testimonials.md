### From Indiana to Northwest Minnesota

> "The second Trump was announced as the winner I started looking for a new job in a trans sanctuary state, and finished moving to MN by early December. It's been interesting to say the least, I have grown to love it here.
>
> Unlike most trans people who will move to this state, I suspect, I'm not a city person so I'm a bit out in the country, closer to Fargo/Moorhead (The Cities) than the Twin cities. I've moved to a small town and my experience has been wonderful so far. The community is so kind, caring, helpful, and they're constantly doing events. Back home in Indiana, a town twice the size of the one I now reside in, there was nothing to do, ever. Here, they advertise public groups and book clubs and theater clubs and orchestras and local dnd groups and just anything and everything to get involved with various types of festivals.
>
> I'm not the most clockable trans woman in the world, but I've also not had a single bad experience with anyone. The few people that do know I'm a flavor or two of queer have been extraordinarily supportive.
>
> It's a struggle not having my support network from back home, all the trans people I had joined support groups with. It's hard being away from family. But I'm recreating a support network here, and it's going quicker than I would've expected. And I've already met people ready to help me at a moments notice if something were to happen to me or, more likely with this freezing weather, my car.
> 
> All in all. The support programs are great. The people are amazing. The community is tight. There's more to do. It's cold. I wish I would've grown up here, it's like living in one of those small town hallmark movies."

### From Missouri to Duluth

> "I moved from Missouri (kc area) to Duluth for a better life. I didnâ€™t want to have to worry about my bodily autonomy anymore. Minnesota is a breath of fresh air! Everyone is nice and welcoming and the nature is breathtaking. I live in Duluth and have easy access to hiking trails, waterfalls and both sand and rock beaches. It feels like Colorado and Washington had a baby but with Midwest prices. I highly recommend relocating! We have great healthcare, politics and education."

### From Oklahoma to the Twin Cities Suburbs

> "My wife is originally from Minnesota. We lived in Oklahoma for several years, and the plan was that after college we would save up and move to the Twin Cities so that she could be close to her family.
>
> I'm a transgender woman, and I'm not very close with my family. My father disowned me, but my mother and sister are both accepting. Outside of them, I don't have anyone. Visiting my mother is both difficult and expensive no matter what distances are involved due to not being allowed back home.
>
> We discovered that while the cost of living is significantly higher than that of Oklahoma, the wages are also significantly higher - and much more stable. Minnesota's economy doesn't experience the boom and bust cycles that Oklahoma's economy experiences with its defense and oil/gas industries.
>
> Finding friends was difficult at first, but we eventually discovered a wonderful friends group through one of the many dog parks that are scattered across the Twin Cities. We found many other transplants from other states, as well as life long Minnesota residents who took us in.
>
> Minnesota is cold, but you adapt quickly. Each season is beautiful for its own reasons, and the opportunities are endless. In every measurable way, it is a better place to live than Oklahoma. While I dearly miss Oklahoma and the people I knew there, I don't see myself ever moving back. I did visit recently after several years and the contrast was stark.
>
> I have never prospered more in my life than in my years living in Minnesota. Here, I got the gender affirming care that I needed, was able to easily change my name and gender marker on my driver's license, and continued a successful career that has allowed me to afford a modest home. I want for nothing here."

### From Texas to Northwest Minnesota

> "My ex-wife, who is still my best friend, is transgender.  We have a daughter together.  We all decided Texas was no longer a safe place for my ex, our daughter, or my ex-'s girlfriend, who is also trans.  While I would have been ok in Texas, they would not have been due to anti-trans legislature that Texas has been passing and the lists of transgender people that Ken Paxton has been compiling.  Since my boyfriend is from Minnesota and since Minnesota has been protecting it's LGBTQ people, we decided it would be the perfect place to go.  More than anything, I miss my family and the food in Texas, but the safety and future of my daughter and my ex are extremely important to me.  I don't want my daughter to grow up in a state where rapists get to choose who becomes the mother of their child.  I want her to be able to control her own body and make those choices for herself, as they are no one else's business.  I'm currently in nursing school in this state, in a wonderful program and everyone is extremely friendly!  The culture here is so diverse, which I feel is necessary for children to be exposed to different peoples.  The more you experience and learn about others, the more empathetic and loving you can be.  Growing up sheltered leads to racism, sexism, and bigotry."

### From A Local in the Twin Cities Suburbs

> "I was born and raised in the beautiful state of Minnesota, just a short 10-minute drive from the vibrant city of Saint Paul. Throughout my life, I have been fortunate to experience an overwhelming amount of kindness and acceptance from 98% of the people around me. 
>
> My journey with my gender identity has been a complex one. For years, I felt lost and confused, but through my own exploration and self-discovery, I came to understand that I am transgender. At the age of 15, I bravely came out to my family, my community, and my church. To my delight, I was embraced with love and support. While there will always be a few who harbor negative feelings, the kindness that surrounds me has far overshadowed any hate.
>
> I take immense pride in calling this place my home. Having spent a year in Florida, I've seen firsthand how difficult it can be for LGBTQ+ individuals in less accepting environments. That experience only deepened my drive to help folks like us and my appreciation for Minnesota, which serves as a refuge and sanctuary for for people like us. We welcome everyone with open arms, and we want to remind you that you have a home here, always. Minnesota is brimming with kind, intelligent, and hardworking individuals who tirelessly advocate for our rights, striving to create a safer and better world for all. Personally, I have never faced bathroom or changing room discrimination in Minnesota; in fact, l've never encountered discrimination at all here. It wasn't until I moved to the South that I faced the harsh realities of intolerance. Here in Minnesota, I don't fear for my safety.
>
> Every day, I thank the universe that I have the privilege of calling this place my home. I genuinely pray that each and every one of you finds your way here. In Minnesota, you will be surrounded by good people who will stand by you and fight with you for your rights. Here, you will find community. Here, you will find love. Here, you will find support. Here, you will find acceptance. Here, you will be safe.
>
> As as 25-year-old transgender woman, I wholeheartedly believe that Minnesota is one of the best places in America for people like us. So, come join us in this incredible, beautiful state where kindness reigns and everyone is welcome!"
