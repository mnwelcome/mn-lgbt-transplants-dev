# Donate

Please consider supporting our [Amazon Wish List](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1WGVXG56XQUSP?ref_=wl_share)!

Most of these items will be used for welcome baskets for incoming transplants. Other items are for storage and monthly social needs. Feel free to substitute items (different brands, colors, etc). 

We also accept item donations, particularly winter gear such as hats and gloves. Contact TCTransplants@gmail.com
