# Piper's Library of Things

A library of things is a collection of items that are loaned out to the community. Examples of things include power tools, camping equipment, etc. Anything that you might need for only a week or two so it doesn't make sense to buy!

We also plan to have designated items for permanent giveaway, especially for recently arrived trans refugees!
